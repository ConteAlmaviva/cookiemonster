This is a simple addon that checks for heal packets sent by the client. When one is seen, it checks if you are a mage (WHM/RDM/BLM/SMN) or COR/WHM, and whether you have a food effect active or not. If you are playing one of those jobs and you do *not* have a food effect on, it checks your inventory for Ginger or Wizard cookies. If you have one (Wizard preferred, Ginger if no Wizard cookies), it uses one and *then* sends a /heal packet. Otherwise, it will just /heal normally. (It is set up to check specifically for /heal packets that aren't /logout or /shutdown.)
